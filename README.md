To run the program, first keep the dataset in the same folder as the codes.
Firstly run the cab_allocation.cpp as :-
  g++ cab_allocation.cpp -o cab_allocation
  .\cab_allocation

Then run the cab_simulator.py as :-
  python .\cab_simulator.py

Other 2 files are just for algorithmic demonstration for finding shortest path and how to show cabs which are nearest to the employee.
